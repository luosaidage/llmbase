"""Stage state — a **derived view** of the log (议 D, v0.7.7).

``StageState`` is the at-a-glance summary operators read; the log is
the source of truth. ``rebuild_state`` is its constructor — walk the
log events, fold them into the dataclass per the contract documented
on the function.

No ``state.json`` on disk. A cached snapshot would risk drifting from
the log on a mid-run crash; instead, callers that want O(1) reads
maintain their own cache, invalidated whenever the log's mtime
changes. The cost of always rebuilding is small — logs are
per-(stage, key), bounded by one run's event count.

    """Reconstruct :class:`StageState` from the log. Contract:

    1. **Last terminal wins within the last round.** A round is the
       slice of events from a ``start`` up to (but not including) the
       next ``start``. ``status`` is the name of the last terminal
       event in the last round; if the last round has none, status is
       ``running``. Earlier rounds' terminals are historical and do
       not set status.

    2. **``attempts`` = count of ``start`` events.** Every
       ``run_stage`` entry writes one ``start``, regardless of how it
       ended.

    3. **Multiple runs → last round.** A log of ``start → ok → start
       → failed`` yields ``status="failed"``, ``attempts=2``,
       ``last_err`` from the second round.

    4. **``started_at`` / ``finished_at``** come from the last round's
       ``start`` and terminal respectively.

    5. **``artifacts``** are unioned across all rounds, set-deduped,
       then sorted — a path that appears twice shows up once.

    6. **``meta``** uses only the last round's events.
       ``meta_init`` from that round's ``start`` seeds it, then every
       ``meta_update`` event overlays last-write-wins. Earlier rounds'
       meta is discarded entirely.

    7. **Torn / malformed lines are skipped** (delegated to
       :func:`tools.pipeline.log.iter_events`).

    This contract is part of llmwiki's stable API. Changes to rebuild
    semantics require a major version bump.
