"""Append-only JSONL audit trail — **log is truth** (议 D, v0.7.7).

Every stage run writes its history here. Driver-written events drive
``state.rebuild_state``; handler-written events (via ``ctx.log``) are
free-form but must not collide with the reserved names.

Layout on disk::

    {base_dir}/.pipeline/{stage}/{sha256(key)}.jsonl

Each line is a complete JSON object with a mandatory ``ts`` (ISO-8601
UTC, added by ``append``) and ``event`` field. Lines are never
half-written: ``append`` takes ``fcntl.LOCK_EX`` on the fd before a
single buffered ``write()``, so concurrent writers serialize and a
crash mid-write leaves the next appender starting on a new offset
(the partial line remains at end-of-file and is skipped by
``iter_events``).

This module is package-internal. Downstream should go through
``run_stage()`` / ``StageContext.log()``, not here directly.

Codex HIGH v0.7.7 round 7 reclassified short-prefix collision: two
unrelated ``(stage, key)`` pairs sharing one JSONL file is not just
spurious ``StageBusyError`` — it cross-contaminates their state
(``rebuild_state`` reads events from both keys as one history) and
their lock (one key's lock gates the other). That's semantic state
corruption, not a livelock, and it matches the precedent set by
``chunk_cache`` (where truncation was flagged as MEDIUM and
full-hash adopted in v0.7.5).

Full 64-hex puts collision probability effectively at zero across any
realistic key universe. Filesystem name limits (255 bytes on
ext4/APFS) are generous enough to swallow a 68-char filename
(``<64-hex>.jsonl``) without concern."""
