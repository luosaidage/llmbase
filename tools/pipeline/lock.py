"""File-based per-stage lock with strict TTL semantics (议 D, v0.7.7).

``StageLock`` provides mutual exclusion for a long-running stage such
as ``wenguan`` (siwen's flagship: 62 太虛 books × hours-long LLM pass),
where a double-run would burn an LLM quota, corrupt a chunk cache, and
serialize back into the sync stage as two conflicting partial writes.

Design (v4, post-review):

- **O_EXCL creation** — acquire is atomic. If two processes race on
  an empty lock slot, only one creates the pidfile; the other sees
  ``FileExistsError`` and falls through to the stale-check path.

- **Stale ↔ live discrimination** by three independent signals:

  1. pidfile missing / malformed / empty / missing required fields
     → stale (treat as recoverable crash).
  2. pidfile's ``host`` differs from current host → stale (we cannot
     verify the PID on another machine; assume its caller is dead).
     **Single-host scope.** This policy is only safe when the
     ``base_dir`` filesystem is dedicated to one machine. On shared
     storage (NFS / CIFS / clustered FS) with multiple writing hosts,
     a legitimately live holder on host X would be classified stale
     by host Y and the lock broken — mutual exclusion violated. If
     you need multi-host, build a separate advisory layer (e.g.
     ``flock(2)`` over NFSv4, or an external mutex like etcd /
     consul) and wrap ``tools.pipeline`` underneath.
  3. pidfile's PID is not alive (``os.kill(pid, 0)`` raises
     ``ProcessLookupError``) → stale.

- **PID-reuse window (known limitation).** If a stale holder's PID
  has been recycled by the kernel and is now held by an unrelated
  live process, ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` reports alive and this lock
  misclassifies the dead holder as live. The pidfile's
  ``started_at`` is recorded for operator inspection but not used
  as an identity token; doing so portably requires ``psutil`` or
  per-OS procfs code the stdlib does not expose cleanly. Siwen's
  usage (processes that die and restart on the same-minute
  timescale, inside a 32k–99k PID space) makes a collision
  vanishingly rare; operators who hit it fall back to
  ``force_break()`` after ``ps -fp <pid>``. Downstream projects
  running longer-dormant stale pidfiles in high-PID-churn
  environments should layer their own identity verification.

- **TTL is informational, not enforcing.** A live-PID on the same host
  is *never* broken by ``acquire()``, even past its recorded TTL —
  that's a hung process and may still hold real resources (an open
  LLM session, a locked file handle). Operators diagnose
  (``ps -fp <pid>``) before calling ``force_break()``.

- **Interrupted event** — when a stale lock is broken, ``acquire``
  first appends ``{"event": "interrupted", "by": "stale_lock_break",
  "prior_pid": ..., "prior_host": ..., "prior_started_at": ...}`` to
  the log. This guarantees ``rebuild_state`` resolves a SIGKILL'd
  prior run to ``status="interrupted"`` instead of stuck ``"running"``.

This module is package-internal. Downstream goes through
``run_stage()``, which acquires + releases as part of its
contextmanager contract.

        two racers (A, B) both read the same stale pidfile H0 outside

        the lock — mutual-exclusion gone.

        The flock breaker makes stale-breaks sequential: only one
        process is inside ``_break_stale`` at a time. Inside, we
