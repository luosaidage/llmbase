"""Content-hash-validated cache for pipeline chunks (议 C, v0.7.5).

Why: downstream wenguan-style pipelines split a source into chunks,
hand each chunk to an LLM, and cache the LLM's output keyed by the
chunk's slot position (``chunks/{idx:02d}.md`` in siwen's original).
When chunk boundaries shift (e.g. splitter rule is tuned, source is
re-OCR'd), the *same* slot now holds *different* content — but the
positional key still resolves, and the cache happily returns the
*old* output. Result: the downstream pipeline stitches together
LLM outputs for chunks that no longer exist. In production at
siwen (2026-04-20) this corrupted 3 books in a single run before
being noticed.

Fix: key by ``(cid, content_hash)`` instead of ``cid`` alone. On
read, *both* must match; a boundary change produces a new
``content_hash`` so the cache correctly misses and forces recompute.

Upstream contract (deliberately minimal — no stage/domain knowledge):

    cache = ChunkCache(base_dir)

    # LLM / expensive computation, guarded by the cache:
    cached = cache.get(cid, content_hash)
    if cached is not None:
        return cached
    output = expensive_call(chunk)
    cache.put(cid, content_hash, output)
    return output

    # Force recompute of a specific slot (e.g. "this chunk is wrong"):
    cache.clear(cid)

``cid``: downstream-chosen string identifying the slot (siwen wenguan:
the chunk's H3 title; line-range pipelines: ``"L{start}-L{end}"``).
``content_hash``: downstream-chosen string identifying the slot's
current content (typically ``hashlib.sha256(chunk_text).hexdigest()``,
but any stable per-content fingerprint works — the cache treats it
as opaque).

Upstream does not compute the content_hash itself: different pipelines
hash different things (raw bytes vs. normalized text vs. structured
dict), and baking in one choice would bind downstream to it. This
parallels the rule-pack / hook pattern used by ``normalize_heads``.
